We have taken ample time to carefully craft this space with tasteful décor, to maximize its potential and ensure your enjoyment","If you visit Albany’s Capital Region without seeing Lark Street, then you have indeed missed its unique and funky urban center. Lark Street is often referred to as the “Greenwich Village” of Albany’s Capital Region. The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance. <br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2e5b6926-a177-4bb6-b01f-9d085e3bbfdf.jpg,433096110,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/433096110,Brian,2021-11-22,"Saratoga Springs, NY","",within an hour,100%,98%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/30c0b064-316a-436f-8b55-6ed68fc044fd.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/30c0b064-316a-436f-8b55-6ed68fc044fd.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,New Scotland,4,4,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Albany, New York, United States",SIXTH WARD,,42.65204,-73.76655,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,1.0,1 bath,1,1,"[""Microwave"", ""Iron"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Shower gel"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Essentials"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Free street parking"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Stainless steel electric stove"", ""Coffee"", ""Radiant heating"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Self check-in"", ""55\"" HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix"", ""First aid kit"", ""Wifi"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, wardrobe, and dresser"", ""Freezer"", ""Hot water"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Dining table"", ""Kitchen"", ""Hangers"", ""Shampoo"", ""Window AC unit"", ""Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Body soap"", ""Oven"", ""Conditioner"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Portable heater"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Private entrance"", ""Bathtub"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Smart lock"", ""Bed linens"", ""Laundromat nearby""]",$99.00,1,28,1,1,28,28,1.0,28.0,,t,16,37,55,320,2024-03-11,180,70,7,2021-12-13,2024-03-08,4.91,4.92,4.86,4.95,4.96,4.79,4.87,,f,3,3,0,0,6.59
